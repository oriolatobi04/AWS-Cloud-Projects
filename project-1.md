#  🛡️ Full-Scale AWS Infrastructure Deployment with IAM Control, Networking, Bastion Host & S3 Integration

 This comprehensive hands-on project is designed to simulate the planning, deployment, access control, and secure operation of an AWS-based infrastructure, following enterprise-level best practices. It begins with IAM governance to ensure correct role-based access and builds out a robust VPC environment with public and private subnets, EC2 provisioning, EC2 & S3-hosted content, and SSH-based bastion access. This project provides a step-by-step guide with interactive images of how this can be achieved.
