**🛡️ End‑to‑End Secure AWS Infrastructure Project – IAM Governance, VPC Networking, Bastion Host & S3 Web Hosting**

This project is a full‑spectrum, hands‑on deployment that walks from blank AWS account to a production‑style environment and back again.  You will architect a custom VPC with public and private subnets, secure it with tight IAM boundaries, expose a bastion host for controlled SSH access, serve a static website whose images live in S3.  Every action—from key‑pair generation to controlled shutdown by a second IAM user

-----

**✅ Key highlights**


- Security first: least‑privilege IAM roles, CIDR‑restricted security groups, bastion‑only jump flow, object‑level S3 access, MFA recommendations.

- Networking mastery: custom VPC (10.0.0.0/16), dual‑AZ public/private subnets, Internet Gateway, optional NAT Gateway.

- Compute & storage: public EC2 (Apache + bastion) and private EC2 backend, S3 bucket hosting six image assets referenced in the site.

- Operational realism: separate DevOps and Secondary Engineer users, CLI credential rotation, controlled shutdown via AWS Console, and Access Analyzer validation.
